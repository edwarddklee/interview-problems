# SOSI SPD Techincal Review Questions: Edward Lee

*Forked Repo for Solving Technical Questions for SOSi Interview*

There are 4 problems in total:

# Geometric.py

**Implemented:**

All test cases work successfully except for one test case ([([345]*10000, 1, 166616670000)]) and gets MemError. The long one works after a few seconds, but that one test case does not work and stalls the program for a very long time, so that line was moved to the end. 


# Shortener.py

**Implemented:**

All test cases works successfully.

# Hero.py

**Implemented:**

From what I remember (forgot to update readme and did hero.go a bit back), most stuff works I believe. 
This was a lot of fun! I had a good time doing this project, and I learned a lot about go and I absolutely love the syntax.
Attempted implementation of mutexes, unsure how well it is implemented.

Tested with postman!


# Vue Project

I discussed this with Hanie (the recruiter that connected me to this job opportunity) and I was busy with work the past week and I honestly put it off until yesterday, but then fell ill and left myself bed-ridden the entire day. Not feeling that much better today, will not be attempting by 12pm today. Although unfortunate that I fell ill as this was a lack of responsibility by me, I will take full blame. I am however interested in what this project is and will be attempting to solve this weekend just on my own time for a learning experience if I am feeling better.
