# SOSI SPD Techincal Review Questions: Edward Lee

*Forked Repo for Solving Technical Questions for SOSi Interview*

There are 4 problems in total:

# Geometric.py

**Implemented:**
All test cases work successfully except for one test case ([([345]*10000, 1, 166616670000)]) and gets MemError. The long one works after a few seconds, but that one test case does not work and stalls the program for a very long time, so that line was moved to the end. 

**If you have any issues at all with configuration of environments, installation of tools, or the general nature of any of the problems, please reach out sooner rather than later! Contact information is in the email you received**
